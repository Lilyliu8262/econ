title: 'Research Papers'
description: I am a Ph.D. in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics graduate from UCLA. My research is about applying machine learning techniques to economic studies. Specifically, I worked on different data structure models, including panel data, cross-sectional data, time series data, and network data. I have published academic papers in top econometric journals. Please click here to see more details, download my PhD dissertation and more research papers.
