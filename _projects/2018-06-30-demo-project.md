subtitle: 'Econometrics and Applied Economics'
description: My research focuses on causal inference, machine learning, and experimental design. I work on data structure models, including cross-sectional, panel, and network data. My current research combines machine learning algorithms with traditional econometric methods for estimating causal effects. Please click to see my research papers.
